# Flight_Site_server

To run the code, you need to do a few simple things. First, you can go to the link of the website that we uploaded and deploy it.
This is the link:
https://flight-site-client.onrender.com/

If you still want to download to your computer and see the code, you can do a git clone
Then do npm i
Then write npm run start and the website works

Make sure to do this on both the client and the server so that things work

Also, make sure that you are moving to the dev branch so that it works because it will not work on the main branch.
